## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-29

### Added

- `NOTICE` file documenting third-party attributions (HNSWlib, Boost).
- `licenses/` directory with full license texts (Apache-2.0, Boost-1.0) and
  compatibility documentation.

### Changed (RC3)

- Prepare 1.0.2 RC3 release.
- Update `README.md` with licensing information.

### Fixed

- Re-added `mysql_close(binlog_conn)` in `myvector_index_build` just before
  `myvector::log_index_build_request` to ensure a fresh connection for binary
  logging.
- Fixed improper use of `get_row_count()` by adding `row_count` member to
  `IndexBuilder` to track progress correctly.
- Enhanced `IndexValidationTest` to execute `myvector_index_check` on the
  built table, ensuring index integrity after construction.
- Resolved build failures on newer MySQL versions (8.4+) by conditionally
  including `<mysqld_error.h>` or `<errmsg.h>` based on `MYSQL_VERSION_ID`.
- Fixed "Unknown system variable 'myvector_nprobes'" error in search functions
  by using the correct system variable name `myvector_vector_nprobes` and
  ensuring it is properly registered and accessible.
- Fixed `myvector_search` returning 0 results by ensuring the index is properly
  loaded and queried using the HNSW algorithm.
- Addressed compilation errors related to `String::c_ptr_safe()` by updating
  code to follow modern MySQL string handling practices.

### Changed

- Improved `README.md` documentation for installation and configuration.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-26

(No changes recorded for this version yet)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-18

### Changed (1.0.0)

- Removed `using namespace std` from all headers to prevent namespace pollution.

### Added (1.0.0)

- Automated test suite using the MySQL Test Run (MTR) framework.
  - Added `mysql-test/suite/myvector/t/vector_construct.test`: Tests for
    `myvector_construct()` UDF.
  - Added `mysql-test/suite/myvector/t/distance_functions.test`: Tests for
    distance calculation UDFs (`myvector_distance_l2`,
    `myvector_distance_cosine`).
  - Added `mysql-test/suite/myvector/t/index_build.test`: Tests for
    `myvector_index_build` stored procedure.
  - Added `mysql-test/suite/myvector/t/search.test`: Tests for vector search
    functionality.
  - Configured `mysql-test/suite/myvector/suite.opt` for plugin loading.

### SQL Functions

- `myvector_construct()` - Constructs a vector string from a standard
  comma-separated list
- `myvector_distance_l2()` - L2 (Euclidean) distance
- `myvector_distance_cosine()` - Cosine distance
- `myvector_add_document()` - Adds a document to the index (internal helper)
- `myvector_search()` - Search for nearest neighbors

### Stored Procedures

- `mysql.myvector_index_build(table_name, vector_column, metric_type)` -
  Builds an HNSW index on a table
- `mysql.myvector_index_check(table_name, vector_column)` - Checks index integrity

### System Variables

- `myvector_vector_limit` (default: 100)
- `myvector_vector_nprobes` (default: 5)

### Documentation

- README.md with build and usage instructions

## [0.0.1] - 2025-06-21

### Added (0.0.1)

- FOSDEM'25 MySQL Devroom presentation ("Vector Search in MySQL").
- Initial proof-of-concept implementation.
